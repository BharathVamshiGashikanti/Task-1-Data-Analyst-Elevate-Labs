Task 1 15th January 2026
Excel Data Cleaning & Formatting Task
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and standardizing a real-world messy dataset using Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets. The goal was to convert raw unstructured data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset by applying professional data cleaning techniques.

📂 Files Included
File Name	Description
Raw_Data.xlsx	Original unmodified dataset
Cleaned_dataset.xlsx	Cleaned and standardized dataset
cleaned_dataset.csv	CSV version of cleaned dataset

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps Performed

Imported the raw CSV data into Excel and verified column headers and delimiters.

Froze header rows and enabled filters for easy data exploration.

Identified missing values and filled them appropriately (e.g., director names, user scores).

Removed duplicate records safely after creating a backup copy.

Standardized text fields using TRIM, PROPER, and UPPER functions.

Corrected inconsistent formats in dates, numeric fields, and categorical columns.

Created a separate Cleaned_Data sheet to maintain raw and processed data layers.

Added a Data_Quality_Notes column to document cleaning actions.

Exported final outputs as Excel and CSV files.

🎯 Outcome

The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis and visualization.
This task demonstrates real-world data preprocessing skills used by data analysts.
